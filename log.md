# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Day 1: Dec 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've installed gitbash tool to run in cmd prompt and cloned my first repository from github.com.

**Thoughts** Though there is still a journey ahead of me, I am optimistic that I was born to code. Side note: There seem to be a bus load more videos out there for MAC users than Windows. Was a little thrown off by videos claiming to work for both OSs'.
